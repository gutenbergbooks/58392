<h2 class="nobreak"><i>A Matter of Manners</i></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN <i>this present day, when chivalry has achieved
at last its perfect bloom, it is hard to realize
that but a scant four centuries ago the children
of even the very best families in England had
to be taught their table manners.</i></p>

<p><i>Today the graces of deportment come by nature
to our youth; and the generation that has produced
the immortal Rollo can not comprehend
the rude manners of the &#8220;bela babee,&#8221; or beautiful
well-born boy of Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s time.</i></p>

<p><i>O, tempora! O, mores! How the times
change and manners multiply! But throughout
the centuries&mdash;on the lengthening road of which
we shall plant another milestone presently with
feasting and merry-making&mdash;good manners and
bad have ever gone hand in hand. And ever has
he of the mind conscious of virtue looked smugly
down on the artless and indifferent vulgarian.</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;The Babees&#8217; Book,&#8221; from which some quaint
extracts are here reprinted, is from old Dr.
Furnivall&#8217;s collection of &#8220;Divers treaties touching
the Manners and Meals of Englishmen in
former days.&#8221; It gives a moving picture of the
domestic life of the Middle Ages. The present
translation out of the archaic language of the
Fifteenth Century into intelligible English has
been made by Edith Rickert, who seems to have
preserved with skill and fidelity the spirit and
form of the antiquated original.</i></p>

<p><i>It will perhaps amuse the good little Rollo of
today to know just how his ancient cousin was
taught to behave at table; and it will interest
his elders to observe that the fundamental basis
of good manners lay then as now in cleanliness,
self respect, reverence and consideration for the
feelings of others.</i></p>

<span class="smaller">OR</span><br />

<span class="small">A LITTLE REPORT OF HOW YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
SHOULD BEHAVE</span></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">MAY He who formed mankind in His
image, support me while I turn this
treatise out of Latin into my common language,
that through this little comment all
of tender years may receive instruction in
courtesy and virtue.</p>

<p>Facet saith that the Book of Courtesy to
teach the practice of virtue is the most helpful
thing in the world, so I will not shrink
from this labour or refuse it; but for mine
own learning will say something that touches
upon the matter.</p>

<p>But oh, young babies, whom blood royal
hath endowed with grace, comeliness, and
high ability, it is on you I call to know this
book, for it were great pity but that ye added
to sovereign beauty virtue and good manners.
Therefore I speak to you specially, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to old men expert in governance, decorum,
and honest manners, for what need is to give
pangs to Hell, joy to Heaven, water to the
sea, or heat to fire already hot?</p>

<p>And so, young babies, my book is only
for your instruction; wherefore I pray that
no man reprehend it, but amend it where it
is at fault, and judge it not, for your own
sake. I seek no other reward but that it may
please men and give you some ease in learning.
Also, sweet children, if there be in it
any word that ye ken not, speer while ye
may, and when ye know it, bear it in mind;
and so by asking you may learn of wise men.
Also, think not too strangely that my pen
writes in this metre; for such verse is commonly
used, therefore take heed.</p>

<p>And first of all, I think to show how you
babies who dwell in households, should &#8217;have
yourselves when ye be set at meat, and how
when men bid you be merry, you should be
ready with lovely, sweet and benign words.
In this, aid me, O Mary, Mother Revered;
and eke, O lady mine, Facetia, guide thou
my pen and show unto me help. For as A
is the first of all letters, so art thou mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of all virtue. Have pity, sweet lady, of my
lack of wit, and though untaught I speak of
demeanour, support my ignorance with thy
goodly aid.</p>

<p>Ah, &#8220;bele babees,&#8221; hearken now to my lore.</p>

<p>When you enter your lord&#8217;s place, say
&#8220;God speed,&#8221; and with humble cheer greet
all who are there present. Do not rush in
rudely, but enter with head up and at an easy
pace, and kneel on one knee only to your
lord or sovereign, whichever he be.</p>

<p>If any speak to you at your coming, look
straight at them with a steady eye, and give
good ear to their words while they be speaking;
and see to it with all your might that
ye jangle not, nor let your eyes wander about
the house, but pay heed to what is said, with
blithe visage and diligent spirit. When ye
answer, ye shall be ready with what ye shall
say, and speak &#8220;things fructuous,&#8221; and give
your reasons smoothly, in words that are
gentle but compendious, for many words are
right tedious to the wise man who listens;
therefore eschew them with diligence.</p>

<p>Take no seat, but be ready to stand until
you are bidden to sit down. Keep your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
hands and feet at rest; do not claw your
flesh or lean against a post, in the presence
of your lord, or handle anything belonging
to the house.</p>

<p>Make obeisance to your lord always when
you answer; otherwise, stand as still as a
stone, unless he speak.</p>

<p>Look with one accord that if ye see any
person better than yourself come in, ye go
backwards anon and give him place, and in
nowise turn your face from him, as far forth
as you may.</p>

<p>If you see your lord drinking, keep silence,
without loud laughter, chattering, whispering,
joking or other insolence.</p>

<p>If he command you to sit in his presence,
fulfil his wish at once, and strive not with
another about your seat.</p>

<p>When you are set down, tell no dishonest
tale; eschew also, with all your might, to be
scornful; and let your cheer be humble, blithe,
and merry, not chiding as if ye were ready
for a fight.</p>

<p>If you perceive that your better is pleased
to commend you, rise up anon and thank
him heartily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>If you see your lord and lady speaking of
household matters, leave them alone, for that
is courtesy, and interfere not with their doing;
but be ready, without feigning, to do your
lord service, and so shall you get a good name.</p>

<p>Also, to fetch him drink, to hold the light
when it is time, and to do whatsoever ought
to be done, look ye be ready; for so shall ye
full soon get a gentle name in nurture. And
if you should ask a boon of God, you can desire
no better thing than to be well-mannered.</p>

<p>If your lord is pleased to offer you his
own cup to drink, rise when you take it, and
receive it goodly with both your hands, and
when you have done, proffer it to no man
else, but render it again to him that brought
it, for in nowise should it be used commonly&mdash;so
wise men teach us.</p>

<p>Now must I tell you shortly what you
shall do at noon when your lord goes to his
meat. Be ready to fetch him clear water,
and some of you hold the towel for him until
he has done, and leave not until he be set
down, and ye have heard grace said. Stand
before him until he bids you sit, and be always
ready to serve him with clean hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>When ye be set, keep your own knife clean
and sharp, that so ye may carve honestly
your own meat.</p>

<p>Let courtesy and silence dwell with you,
and tell no foul tales to another.</p>

<p>Cut your bread with your knife and break
it not. Lay a clean trencher before you,
and when your pottage is brought, take your
spoon and eat quietly; and do not leave your
spoon in the dish, I pray you.</p>

<p>Look ye be not caught leaning on the
table, and keep clear of soiling the cloth.</p>

<p>Do not hang your head over your dish,
or in any wise drink with full mouth.</p>

<p>Keep from picking your nose, your teeth,
your nails at meal-time&mdash;so we are taught.</p>

<p>Advise you against taking so muckle meat
into your mouth but that ye may right well
answer when men speak to you.</p>

<p>When ye shall drink, wipe your mouth
clean with a cloth, and your hands also, so
that you shall not in any way soil the cup,
for then shall none of your companions be
loth to drink with you.</p>

<p>Likewise, do not touch the salt in the salt-cellar
with any meat; but lay salt honestly
on your trencher, for that is courtesy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Do not carry your knife to your mouth
with food, or hold the meat with your hands
in any wise; and also if divers good meats
are brought to you, look that with all courtesy
ye assay of each; and if your dish be
taken away with its meat and another brought
courtesy demands that ye shall let it go and
not ask for it back again.</p>

<p>And if strangers be set at table with you,
and savoury meat be brought or sent to you,
make them good cheer with part of it, for
certainly it is not polite when others be present
at meat with you, to keep all that is
brought you, and like churls vouchsafe nothing
to others.</p>

<p>Do not cut your meat like field-men who
have such an appetite that they reck not in
what wise, where or when or how ungoodly
they hack at their meat; but, sweet children,
have always your delight in courtesy and in
gentleness, and eschew boisterousness with all
your might.</p>

<p>When cheese is brought, have a clean
trencher, on which with a clean knife ye may
cut it; and in your feeding look ye appear
goodly, and keep your tongue from jangling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
for so indeed shall ye deserve a name for
gentleness and good governance, and always
advance yourself in virtue.</p>

<p>When the end of the meal is come, clean
your knives, and look you put them up
where they ought to be, and keep your
seat until you have washed, for so wills
honesty.</p>

<p>When ye have done, look then that ye
rise up without laughter or joking or boisterous
word, and go to your lord&#8217;s table, and
there stand, and pass not from him until grace
be said and brought to an end.</p>

<p>Then some of you should go for water,
some hold the cloth, some pour upon his
hands.</p>

<p>Other things I might commend you to do,
but as my time is brief, I put them not into
this little report; but overpass them, praying
with a spirit that rejoices in this labour, that
no man abuse me; but where too little is, let
him add more, and where too much, let him
take away, for though I would, time forbids
that I say more. Therefore I take my leave,
and inscribe this book to every wight whom
it may please to correct it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>And, sweet children, for love of whom I
write, I beseech you, with very loving heart,
that you set your delight upon knowing this
book; and may Almighty God that suffered
bitter pains, make you so expert in courtesy
that through your nurture and your governance
you may advance yourselves to lasting
bliss.</p>
